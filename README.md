This project automates the monitoring of system resource usage (CPU and GPU) for Docker containers during a load test. It logs the real-time usage data into a database and, once the test ends, summarizes the average usage in an Excel sheet.

Features

Continuously records CPU and GPU usage statistics for each container.

Stores detailed usage logs into a MySQL database.

Calculates average CPU and GPU usage after the test.

Outputs summarized data to an Excel file.
